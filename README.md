# Module 3 Challenge: Javascript Homework

This Homework assignment was completed for Unit Three of the U of M Bootcamp, to practice javascript work, namely with writing functions, variables, arrays, and objects. The complete code interacts with an html UI which allows user input on employee data to be displayed, with salaries averaged, in a table on the webpage.
